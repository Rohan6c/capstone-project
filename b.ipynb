Both are multicultural as well as the financial hubs of their respective countries. We want to explore how much they are similar or dissimilar in aspects from a tourist point of view regarding food, accommodation, beautiful places, and many more.\nToday Tourism is one of the pillars of the economy and the people most often visits those countries who are rich in heritage and developed enough from a foreign prospective, like friendly environment. Every city is unique in their own way and give something new. And now the information is so common regarding location of every place around the world on your fingertips which make it easier to explore.

The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, \u201cClustering\u201d to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist\u2019s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis.\nMETHODOLOGY\nAs we have selected two cities Borough to explore their neighborhoods. The data exploration, analysis and visualization for both boroughs are done in the same way but separately.\u00b6"

The neighborhoods are much similar in features like Theaters, opera houses, food places, clubs, museums, parks etc. As far as concern to dissimilarity, it differs in terms of some unique places like historical places and monuments.\nObservations & Recommendations\nWhen we compare the tourist places, we observe that the historical place is only situated in Downtown Toronto and the Monument or landmark venue is in Manhattan neighborhoods. Similarly, Airport facility, Harbor, Sculpture garden and Boat or ferry services are also available i**n Downtown Toronto while venues like Nightlife, Climbing gym and Museums are present in Manhattan.\nAs far as concern to recommendations, we recommend Downtown Toronto Neighborhoods will be considered first to visit. The tourists have an easily travelling access due to Airport facility, which not only saves time but also helps to save money. This saved money can be utilized to explore more, the attracting venues.\n"
